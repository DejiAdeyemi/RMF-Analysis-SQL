# RMF-Analysis-SQL
RFM analysis is an abbreviation for "Recency, Frequency, and Monetary" analysis. It is a data-driven marketing method that uses historical purchasing behaviour to segment customers.
Recency represents how recently a consumer made a purchase, Frequency tells how frequently they made purchases within a given time, and Monetary indicates the total amount paid. Businesses can identify different client groupings, such as high-value, loyal consumers, potential churn risks, or inactive customers, by analysing these three variables.
RFM analysis assists organisations in tailoring their marketing strategy to properly target each category. It enables them to target high-value consumers with personalised offers, re-engage inactive customers, and optimise marketing efforts based on customer behaviour. Ultimately, this data-driven approach improves customer retention, loyalty, and overall profitability.





Imagine a retail company facing a decline in sales and wants to identify the underlying reasons and potential solutions. They decide to apply RFM analysis to their customer data.
The data analyst first divides clients into groups based on their recency, frequency, and monetary values using RFM. They come across a group of high-value clients who have recently made frequent purchases, representing the company's most loyal sector. This insight shows that keeping these clients engaged should be a priority, and the organisation may consider introducing loyalty programmes or unique offers to do so.
The data analyst, on the other hand, discovers a group of clients with low recency, which means they haven't made a purchase in a long time. This group may be on the verge of churn, and the organisation can utilise RFM to design targeted re-engagement programmes, offering incentives or discounts to get them back.
The study also reveals another group with a high frequency but low monetary worth. Customers in this category make frequent yet little purchases. The organisation might focus on upselling or cross-selling methods to enhance the average order value from these clients to increase their lifetime value.
Overall, RFM analysis delivers useful insights that help data analysts to make data-driven decisions. They can improve marketing efforts, target specific client segments, and prioritise customer retention initiatives. RFM analysis allows the organisation to obtain a better understanding of its customer base and take necessary actions to increase sales, customer loyalty, and profitability.
